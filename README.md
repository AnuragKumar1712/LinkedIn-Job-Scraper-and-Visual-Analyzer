# LinkedIn Job Scraper and Visual Analyzer  

This project automates the process of extracting job postings from LinkedIn, classifying them based on job titles, and visualizing trends to gain insights into the job market. It is designed to help job seekers, analysts, and researchers understand hiring trends by domain and sub-category.  

## Features  
- **Web Scraping**:  
  - Extracts job titles, company names, job locations, and application links from LinkedIn job listings.  
  - Skips incomplete or masked job listings to maintain data accuracy.  

- **Job Classification**:

  - Uses keyword matching to further assign sub-categories (e.g., Frontend Developer, Data Scientist).  

- **Data Visualization**:  
  - Generates a bar chart to visualize the number of job postings in each sub-category using Matplotlib.  
  - Highlights hiring trends to better understand demand for specific job roles.
